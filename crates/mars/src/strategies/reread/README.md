# ReRead (RE2)

ReRead is a simple yet effective optimization strategy that encourages the model to reconsider a question by re-reading it before answering. This minimal intervention technique can improve answer quality without significant overhead.

## Algorithm Overview

ReRead follows a straightforward two-step process:

### Step 1: Present Original Question
Provide the user's question to the model.

### Step 2: Re-read and Answer
Include a prompt encouraging the model to re-read the question before providing the answer.

The full prompt becomes:
```
[Original Question]

Read the question again: [Original Question]
```

This simple repetition encourages the model to:
- Reconsider the question more carefully
- Catch nuances it may have missed
- Provide more thoughtful responses
- Reduce hasty or incomplete answers

## How It Works in Practice

### Example: Mathematical Problem

**Original Query:**
```
What is the surface area of a cube with side length 5?
```

**ReRead Format:**
```
What is the surface area of a cube with side length 5?

Read the question again: What is the surface area of a cube with side length 5?
```

The model, prompted to reconsider, is more likely to:
- Correctly identify it's asking for surface area (not volume)
- Remember the formula (6 × side²)
- Calculate accurately: 6 × 25 = 150

### Example: Natural Language

**Original Query:**
```
Summarize the main themes of "The Great Gatsby"
```

**ReRead Format:**
```
Summarize the main themes of "The Great Gatsby"

Read the question again: Summarize the main themes of "The Great Gatsby"
```

By re-reading, the model is prompted to:
- Focus on themes specifically (not plot)
- Be more comprehensive in identifying multiple themes
- Provide deeper analysis

## When to Use ReRead

✅ **Best For:**
- Quick quality improvement with minimal overhead
- Tasks where careful reading matters
- Questions that might be ambiguous or easily misunderstood
- Situations where the model tends to rush
- Simple to moderately complex queries
- Cost-conscious applications (very low overhead)
- As a baseline improvement technique

❌ **Not Ideal For:**
- Tasks already optimized for careful reading
- Real-time applications requiring minimal latency
- Extremely complex problems needing deep reasoning
- Tasks already using other reasoning strategies
- Creative generation (re-reading doesn't help)
- Adversarial or verification tasks

## Configuration

```rust
use optillm_mars::strategies::reread::{ReReadConfig, ReReadAggregator};

// Default configuration
let config = ReReadConfig::new();

// Custom configuration
let config = ReReadConfig::new()
    .with_temperature(0.5)
    .with_max_tokens(2048);

// Manual configuration
let config = ReReadConfig {
    temperature: 0.7,          // Moderate for coherent responses
    max_tokens: 4096,
};
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `temperature` | 0.7 | Temperature for response generation (0.0-2.0) |
| `max_tokens` | 4096 | Maximum tokens for response |

## Usage Example

```rust
use optillm_mars::strategies::reread::{ReReadConfig, ReReadAggregator};
use optillm_core::ModelClient;

// Configure ReRead with custom temperature
let config = ReReadConfig::new()
    .with_temperature(0.6)
    .with_max_tokens(3000);

// Run ReRead strategy
let result = ReReadAggregator::run_reread(
    "What are the three branches of government?",
    "You are a civics expert",
    config,
    &client
).await?;

println!("Answer: {}", result.answer);
println!("Tokens used: {}", result.metadata.total_tokens);
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Token Usage
Per execution:
- Single generation with re-read prompt: ~1,500-3,000 tokens
- Total overhead: Minimal (just the repetition of the question)

### Latency
- Single generation pass: ~3-8 seconds with standard LLM
- Very fast compared to other strategies

### Quality Impact
- **Improvement:** +5-15% on tasks where careful reading matters
- **Consistency:** Slight improvement in consistency
- **Overhead:** Negligible (single pass)

## Key Insights

### Simplicity is Powerful
ReRead proves that sometimes the simplest interventions work best. Adding a prompt to re-read requires no complex logic, yet produces measurable improvements.

### Why Re-reading Helps
1. **Attention Reset:** Forces model to restart attention mechanism
2. **Context Reinforcement:** Repeated context improves focus
3. **Deliberation:** Models spend more tokens reconsidering
4. **Error Detection:** Re-reading catches mistakes on second pass

### Low-Cost Baseline
ReRead is an excellent baseline strategy:
- Use it first to get quick gains
- Compare it against more complex strategies
- Combine it with other techniques for greater effect
- Minimal computational overhead

## Advanced Features

### Temperature Control
- **Low (0.3-0.4):** More focused, factual responses
- **Medium (0.6-0.8):** Balanced between creativity and focus
- **High (0.9-1.5):** More exploratory, varied responses

### Context Length
Adjust max_tokens based on expected answer length:
- **Short answers (definitions, facts):** 512-1024 tokens
- **Medium answers (explanations):** 1024-4096 tokens
- **Long answers (essays, analyses):** 4096-8192 tokens

## Comparison with Other Strategies

| Strategy | Approach | Cost | Speed | Improvement |
|----------|----------|------|-------|------------|
| **ReRead** | Re-reading | Very Low | Fast | +5-15% |
| **Best-of-N** | Multiple attempts | Medium | Slow | +10-20% |
| **CoT Reflection** | Self-reflection | Medium | Medium | +15-25% |
| **Self-Consistency** | Voting | High | Slow | +15-25% |
| **PVG** | Adversarial | Very High | Very Slow | +20-30% |

## Implementation Notes

- **Single Pass:** ReRead executes in a single generation pass
- **Prompt Format:** Question is repeated in prompt for re-reading cue
- **No Post-processing:** Response is returned as-is
- **Token Counting:** Total tokens from single generation call

## Common Pitfalls

⚠️ **No multi-turn:** ReRead is single-pass, not interactive dialogue
⚠️ **Not for complex reasoning:** Won't replace deep reasoning strategies
⚠️ **Context matters:** Works best on questions that benefit from careful reading
⚠️ **Diminishing returns:** Doesn't compound with multiple applications
⚠️ **Not for creative tasks:** Re-reading doesn't help generation tasks

**Original Implementation:**
- Python optillm: `optillm/reread.py`
- Simple, focused implementation

## When to Combine with Other Strategies

ReRead works well with:
- **Best-of-N:** Use ReRead for each attempt for better individual responses
- **Voting strategies:** ReRead before generating responses to vote on
- **Reflection:** ReRead as baseline before reflection
- **As preprocessing:** Always include re-reading in more complex pipelines

## Practical Tips

1. **Baseline First:** Always run ReRead as your first optimization attempt
2. **Question Type Matters:** Works best on questions with key details
3. **Temperature Tuning:** Lower temperature (0.4-0.6) for factual questions
4. **Token Adjustment:** Match max_tokens to expected response length
5. **Combine Wisely:** Great when paired with other strategies

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-read:** Multiple passes through the question
- **Selective Re-reading:** Re-read only ambiguous parts
- **Guided Focus:** Highlight key aspects of question
- **Comparative Approach:** Compare initial and revised answers
- **Confidence Measurement:** Measure confidence before/after re-reading
