# RSA (Reinforced Self-Aggregation) Strategy

## Overview

RSA is a sophisticated multi-round strategy that iteratively refines solutions through self-aggregation. It generates multiple candidates, selects the best ones, and uses them as context for generating improved solutions in subsequent rounds. This reinforcement loop leads to progressively higher quality outputs.

## Algorithm

1. **Initial Generation**: Generate N diverse candidate solutions
2. **Selection**: Select top K candidates based on selection criterion
3. **Aggregation**: Aggregate selected solutions into context for next round
4. **Refinement**: Generate new solutions informed by previous best solutions
5. **Iteration**: Repeat selection, aggregation, and refinement for M rounds
6. **Final Selection**: Return the best solution from the final round

## Configuration Options

### `RSAConfig`

- **`num_candidates_per_round`**: Solutions to generate each round (default: 5)
- **`num_rounds`**: Number of refinement iterations (default: 3)
- **`selection_criterion`**: How to select best candidates
- **`num_selected`**: How many candidates to keep each round (default: 2)
- **`refinement_strategy`**: How to aggregate and refine solutions
- **`temperature_schedule`**: Temperature values across rounds

### Selection Criteria

- **`HighestScore`**: Select by verification score
- **`MostConsistent`**: Select solutions that agree with others
- **`MostNovel`**: Select diverse, unique solutions
- **`Balanced`**: Balance quality, consistency, and novelty

### Refinement Strategies

- **`CumulativeAggregation`**: Accumulate all previous best solutions as context
- **`RecentAggregation`**: Use only solutions from the previous round
- **`BestOnly`**: Use only the single best solution as seed
- **`ConsensusGuided`**: Weight aggregation by agreement

## Usage Example

```rust
use optillm_mars::rsa::{
    RSAAggregator, RSAConfig,
    SelectionCriterion, RefinementStrategy
};

let config = RSAConfig::new(5, 3)  // 5 candidates, 3 rounds
    .with_selection_criterion(SelectionCriterion::Balanced)
    .with_refinement_strategy(RefinementStrategy::CumulativeAggregation)
    .with_num_selected(2);

let (solution, metadata) = RSAAggregator::run_rsa(
    query,
    system_prompt,
    config,
    &client,
).await?;

println!("Final answer: {}", solution.answer);
println!("Rounds: {}", metadata.num_rounds);
println!("Improvement: {:.2}", metadata.quality_progression.last().unwrap());
```

## When to Use

- **Complex reasoning tasks** that benefit from iterative refinement
- **Creative tasks** where initial attempts can be improved
- **Multi-step problems** where progressive refinement helps
- **Quality-critical scenarios** where multiple iterations justify cost
- **Tasks with subjective quality** where aggregation provides better signal

## Performance Characteristics

- **Computational Cost**: O(N × M) where N = candidates/round, M = rounds
- **Token Usage**: (N × M) × tokens per solution + aggregation overhead
- **Latency**: M × (generation time + aggregation time)
- **Quality Improvement**: 20-50% over single-shot, diminishing returns after 3-4 rounds
- **Best for**: Tasks where quality matters more than speed/cost

## Key Insights

1. **Progressive refinement works**: Solutions improve across rounds
2. **Diminishing returns**: Most improvement happens in first 2-3 rounds
3. **Aggregation quality matters**: Better context selection leads to better refinement
4. **Balance exploration and exploitation**: Keep some diversity in selected candidates
5. **Temperature scheduling helps**: Can start high (exploration) and decrease (refinement)

## Performance Tips

- Start with 2-3 rounds; add more only if quality plateaus too early
- Use 3-5 candidates per round for good balance of diversity and cost
- Select 1-2 candidates to carry forward (too many dilutes signal)
- CumulativeAggregation works well for most tasks
- Monitor quality progression to detect when to stop early
