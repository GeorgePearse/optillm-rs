# AutoThink Strategy

## Overview

AutoThink is a complexity-aware optimization strategy that analyzes query characteristics and automatically selects optimal parameters based on problem difficulty.

## Key Features

- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Analyzes length, vocabulary, reasoning keywords, domain indicators, and structure
- **Adaptive Temperature Selection**: Scales from 0.3 (simple) to 1.0 (complex)
- **Complexity Classification**: Categorizes queries as Simple, Medium, or Complex
- **Efficient**: Single-pass analysis with no additional API calls

## How It Works

AutoThink uses a 5-factor difficulty estimation algorithm:

1. **Length Analysis (20%)**: Word count ranges indicate complexity
   - 0-10 words: Simple
   - 11-30 words: Somewhat simple
   - 31-70 words: Medium
   - 71-150 words: More complex
   - 150+ words: Very complex

2. **Vocabulary Complexity (25%)**: Analyzes word sophistication
   - Advanced vocabulary detection (theorem, methodology, optimization)
   - Average word length (longer = more complex)
   - Domain-specific jargon (matrix, integral, algorithm)

3. **Reasoning Keywords (25%)**: Weighted keyword detection
   - High weight (1.0): prove, derive, recursive
   - Medium weight (0.8-0.9): analyze, optimize, design
   - Lower weight (0.6-0.7): explain, compare, solve

4. **Domain Indicators (15%)**: Identifies specialized domains
   - Mathematical: calculus, algebra, topology
   - Programming: algorithms, data structures
   - Physics: quantum, relativity, mechanics
   - Logic: proof, axiom, theorem

5. **Structural Complexity (15%)**: Analyzes query structure
   - Multi-question queries
   - Nested structures (parentheses, brackets)
   - Sentence length
   - Separators (colons, semicolons)

## Configuration

```rust
let config = AutoThinkConfig {
    simple_token_threshold: 50,
    complex_token_threshold: 150,
    simple_temperature: 0.3,
    medium_temperature: 0.6,
    complex_temperature: 1.0,
};
```

## Temperature Selection

Temperature automatically scales based on complexity:

| Complexity | Temperature | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Simple | 0.3 | Factual questions, definitions, straightforward problems |
| Medium | 0.6 | Mixed reasoning, some exploration needed |
| Complex | 1.0 | Proofs, algorithm design, theoretical problems |

## Advantages

- **Intelligent Parameter Selection**: No need to manually tune temperature
- **Domain Aware**: Recognizes mathematical, programming, and scientific problems
- **Efficient**: Lightweight analysis, no additional model calls
- **Comprehensive**: Considers multiple difficulty signals

## Use Cases

- Mathematical problem-solving
- Algorithm design and optimization
- Theory proofs and derivations
- Complex system analysis
- Research question answering

## Examples

### Simple Query
```
"What is the capital of France?"
→ Complexity: Simple (0.2)
→ Temperature: 0.3 (deterministic)
```

### Medium Query
```
"Explain how quicksort works and analyze its time complexity"
→ Complexity: Medium (0.5)
→ Temperature: 0.6 (balanced)
```

### Complex Query
```
"Prove that the Riemann Hypothesis is true or provide a counterexample using mathematical rigor"
→ Complexity: Complex (0.85)
→ Temperature: 1.0 (exploratory)
```

## Performance Tips

- Works best for academic and technical queries
- Vocabulary analysis may be less effective for non-English queries
- Domain detection optimized for math, CS, physics, logic
- Can be combined with other strategies for enhanced results
