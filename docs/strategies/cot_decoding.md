# CoT Decoding Strategy

## Overview

CoT Decoding guides models to follow structured chain-of-thought reasoning patterns, improving answer quality through systematic step-by-step problem decomposition.

## Key Features

- **Structured Templates**: Provides reasoning templates for different problem types
- **Multiple Patterns**: Linear, Tree, Dialogue, and Analysis-Synthesis structures
- **Step Verification**: Validates extracted reasoning steps
- **Quality Improvement**: Ensures clear logical flow

## Reasoning Structures

### 1. Linear Structure
Step-by-step sequential reasoning. Best for:
- Mathematical proofs
- Algorithm design
- Sequential problem-solving

```
Step 1: [First observation]
Step 2: [Second observation]
Step 3: [Synthesis]
Final Answer: [Solution]
```

### 2. Tree Structure
Exploration of multiple approaches. Best for:
- Design decisions
- Comparative analysis
- Multi-branch reasoning

```
Approach A: [First path]
Approach B: [Alternative path]
Approach C: [Another option]
Best Approach: [Selection and why]
Final Answer: [Solution]
```

### 3. Dialogue Structure
Q&A style reasoning. Best for:
- Clarification-heavy problems
- Exploratory reasoning
- Interactive understanding

```
Question: [Problem restated]
Observation 1: [First insight]
Observation 2: [Second insight]
Verification: [Check reasoning]
Answer: [Final answer]
```

### 4. Analysis-Synthesis
Decompose and recombine. Best for:
- Complex system analysis
- Integration of multiple elements
- Comprehensive solutions

```
Analysis:
- Element 1: [Details]
- Element 2: [Details]
- Element 3: [Details]
Synthesis: [Combine elements]
Final Answer: [Comprehensive answer]
```

## Configuration

```rust
let config = CotDecodingConfig {
    structure: ReasoningStructure::Linear,
    num_steps: 4,
    enable_verification: true,
};
```

## How It Works

1. **Template Selection**: Choose appropriate reasoning structure
2. **Guided Generation**: Model follows template to decompose problem
3. **Step Extraction**: Parse and extract individual reasoning steps
4. **Verification** (optional): Validate that reasoning is complete
5. **Answer Extraction**: Extract final answer from structured output

## Advantages

- **Improved Clarity**: Forces explicit reasoning steps
- **Verifiable Logic**: Each step can be examined
- **Structure Guidance**: Templates prevent rambling
- **Flexible**: Multiple structures for different problem types
- **Error Detection**: Verification catches incomplete reasoning

## Use Cases

- Mathematical proofs
- Algorithm design
- Complex problem-solving
- Educational explanations
- Formal reasoning requirements

## Examples

### Linear Example
```
Problem: "Prove that sqrt(2) is irrational"

Step 1: Assume sqrt(2) is rational
Step 2: Express as p/q in lowest terms
Step 3: Show p must be even
Step 4: Show q must be even
Contradiction: Contradicts lowest terms assumption

Final Answer: sqrt(2) is irrational
```

### Tree Example
```
Problem: "What's the best data structure for this use case?"

Approach A: Array - O(1) access, O(n) insert
Approach B: LinkedList - O(n) access, O(1) insert
Approach C: HashTable - O(1) average, memory overhead
Best: HashTable for this scenario

Final Answer: Use HashTable
```

## Performance Tips

- **Linear**: Best for sequential reasoning (70% of cases)
- **Tree**: Use for decision-heavy problems
- **Dialogue**: Effective for exploratory reasoning
- **Analysis-Synthesis**: For integrated solutions
- Enable verification for critical applications

## Step Quality Indicators

Good reasoning steps:
- Clearly numbered or marked
- Logical flow and dependencies
- Explicit intermediate results
- Conclusion before final answer
