# Deep Thinking Strategy

## Overview

Deep Thinking allocates computational resources proportionally to problem difficulty, providing harder problems with more reasoning capacity for superior quality.

## Key Features

- **Difficulty-Based Scaling**: Token allocation scales from min to max based on problem difficulty
- **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple iterations with increasing complexity
- **Consistency Tracking**: Selects solution with best cross-iteration consistency
- **Adaptive**: Automatically calibrates reasoning depth

## How It Works

1. **Difficulty Estimation**: Analyzes query to estimate problem complexity
2. **Token Allocation**: Maps difficulty (0.0-1.0) to token budget
   - Simple problems: minimal tokens (min_tokens)
   - Complex problems: maximum tokens (max_tokens)
3. **Iterative Generation**: Performs multiple iterations with increasing complexity
4. **Consistency Ranking**: Selects answer most consistent across iterations

## Configuration

```rust
let config = DeepThinkingConfig {
    min_tokens: 256,      // Minimum for any problem
    max_tokens: 2048,     // Maximum for hardest problems
    num_iterations: 3,    // Number of refinement iterations
};
```

## Token Allocation Formula

```
tokens = min_tokens + (difficulty × (max_tokens - min_tokens))
```

- Difficulty 0.0 (simple) → min_tokens tokens
- Difficulty 0.5 (medium) → avg tokens
- Difficulty 1.0 (complex) → max_tokens tokens

## Advantages

- **Resource Efficiency**: Avoids wasting computation on simple problems
- **Quality Improvement**: Complex problems receive more thinking capacity
- **Consistency-Based**: Selects most robust solutions
- **Transparent**: Clear token allocation strategy

## Use Cases

- Variable-difficulty problem solving
- Adaptive reasoning for mixed query types
- Resource-constrained environments
- Ensuring consistency across attempts

## Examples

### Simple Query
```
"What is 2+2?"
→ Difficulty: 0.1
→ Token Budget: 300 tokens
→ Iterations: 1-2 (quick)
```

### Medium Query
```
"Analyze the time complexity of merge sort"
→ Difficulty: 0.5
→ Token Budget: 1,100 tokens
→ Iterations: 3 (moderate depth)
```

### Complex Query
```
"Design an optimal distributed consensus algorithm"
→ Difficulty: 0.9
→ Token Budget: 1,900 tokens
→ Iterations: 3-5 (deep reasoning)
```

## Performance Tips

- Set min_tokens based on minimum acceptable answer quality
- Set max_tokens based on available budget
- num_iterations = 3-5 works well for most use cases
- Consistency scoring works best with 3+ iterations
