# Entropy Decoding Strategy

## Overview

Entropy Decoding uses Shannon entropy to control response diversity, providing fine-grained control over the balance between novelty and quality through entropy-aware sampling.

## Key Features

- **Entropy-Based Sampling**: Controls diversity via Shannon entropy rather than just temperature
- **Multiple Samples**: Generates diverse candidates with varying entropy targets
- **Quality-Diversity Balance**: Configurable weighting between quality and entropy
- **Entropy Metrics**: Tracks and reports entropy statistics

## How It Works

1. **Sample Generation**: Creates multiple samples with varying entropy targets
2. **Entropy Calculation**: Computes Shannon entropy for each sample
   - Entropy 0.0: Completely deterministic
   - Entropy 0.5: Balanced
   - Entropy 1.0: Maximum randomness
3. **Combined Scoring**: Ranks samples by entropy×entropy_weight + quality×(1-entropy_weight)
4. **Selection**: Chooses sample with best combined score

## Configuration

```rust
let config = EntropyDecodingConfig {
    target_entropy: 0.6,        // Aim for balanced entropy
    num_samples: 3,             // Generate 3 diverse samples
    min_temperature: 0.3,
    max_temperature: 1.2,
    entropy_weight: 0.5,        // 50% diversity, 50% quality
};
```

## Entropy Targets

| Target Entropy | Characteristics | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| 0.0-0.3 | Low diversity, focused | Factual questions, precise answers needed |
| 0.3-0.7 | Balanced | General problem-solving, mixed accuracy |
| 0.7-1.0 | High diversity | Creative tasks, exploration needed |

## Entropy Weight Parameter

- **entropy_weight = 0.0**: Pure quality focus (like temperature-based sampling)
- **entropy_weight = 0.5**: Balanced quality and diversity (recommended)
- **entropy_weight = 1.0**: Pure diversity focus (maximum novelty)

## Advantages

- **Fine-Grained Control**: More precise than temperature alone
- **Diversity Metrics**: Explicit entropy measurement
- **Configurable Balance**: Adjust quality/diversity tradeoff
- **Multiple Perspectives**: Generate varied solutions systematically

## Use Cases

- Creative problem-solving
- Generating diverse hypotheses
- Exploring solution space
- Balanced quality/novelty requirements
- Multi-perspective analysis

## Examples

### Low Entropy (Focus)
```
"Define machine learning"
→ target_entropy: 0.2
→ entropy_weight: 0.1
→ Result: Consistent, focused definitions
```

### Balanced Entropy
```
"What are different approaches to database design?"
→ target_entropy: 0.5
→ entropy_weight: 0.5
→ Result: Multiple valid approaches with reasonable quality
```

### High Entropy (Exploration)
```
"Generate creative ideas for autonomous systems"
→ target_entropy: 0.8
→ entropy_weight: 0.8
→ Result: Diverse, novel perspectives
```

## Performance Tips

- Start with entropy_weight = 0.5 (balanced)
- Lower weight for factual/technical questions
- Higher weight for creative/exploratory tasks
- num_samples should be 3-5 for good diversity
- Monitor entropy_score in metadata for insights

## Mathematical Background

Shannon Entropy: H = -Σ(p_i × log₂(p_i))
- Higher entropy = more uniform probability distribution
- Lower entropy = more concentrated distribution
